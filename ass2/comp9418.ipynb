    "In the practical component of this assignment you will build a *class-conditional classifier* using the mixture model described in the theory section of this assignment.\n",

    "The basic idea behind a class conditional classifier is to train a separate model for each class $p(\\mathbf{x} \\mid y)$, and use Bayes' rule to classify a novel data-point $\\mathbf{x}^*$ with:\n",

    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "You will require the following packages for this assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `numpy`\n",
    "- `scipy`\n",
    "- `scikit-learn`\n",
    "- `matplotlib`\n",
    "- `observations`\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these may be installed with `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib observations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Unless otherwise indicated, you may not use any ML libraries and frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow to implement any training-related code. Your solution should be implement purely in NumPy/SciPy.\n",
    "2. Do not delete any of the existing code-blocks in this notebook. It will be used to assess the performance of your algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "Your work will be assessed based on:\n",
    "- **[50%]** the application of the concepts for doing model selection, which allows you to learn a single model for prediction (Section 1);  \n",
    "- **[30%]** the code you write for making predicitions in your model (Section 2); and\n",
    "- **[20%]** the predictive performance of your model (Section 3). "
